To address the problem of predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving the XYZ and seasonal flu vaccines, we can develop a machine learning model using the provided dataset. Here is a step-by-step outline to build and train the model:

Step-by-Step Process
Data Preparation:

Load the datasets (training_set_features.csv, training_set_labels.csv, test_set_features.csv).
Merge the training features and labels on respondent_id.
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables as necessary.
Feature Engineering:

Analyze and preprocess the features:
Convert categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable model for binary classification tasks. For this problem, we will use a gradient boosting model, such as XGBoost, which is effective for tabular data and provides probabilities as outputs.
Model Training:

Split the training data into training and validation sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set using ROC AUC.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using ROC AUC for both xyz_vaccine and seasonal_vaccine.
Optimize hyperparameters if necessary.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict probabilities on the test set.
Prepare the submission file in the required format.
